      "content": "The correct answer is **c) Less than zero**. According to the context (p. 3.0), the objective is to maintain net interest cost as a proportion of total own-source revenue for the General Government Sector less than zero. Additionally, on page 4.0, it is stated that \"The Governmentâ€™s target for this measure is to ensure that the level of net interest cost remains negative, indicating the Territory can comfortably meet interest expenses.\" This information directly supports option c as the correct answer. The net interest cost as a percentage of own-source revenue is provided in Table 1.2.4, which shows negative values for all years, further confirming the target of less than zero (p. 4.0)."
