However, I can provide information based on the provided context.\n\nThe context provides information about the financial policy objectives and strategies of the Government, as outlined in the 2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3. The short-term financial objectives include maintaining a Triple A credit rating, maintaining low levels of debt, taking a strategic approach to the capital works program, and providing the highest possible standard of Government services (p. 2.0). The long-term financial objectives are to maintain Territory infrastructure, make adequate provision for long-term liabilities, minimize risk to Territory finances and assets, and maintain or reduce GGS debt (p. 2.0).\n\nThe key measures for the short-term objectives are to maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle, maintain the capital infrastructure of the Territory, keep the net interest cost as a proportion of total own-source revenue for the GGS less than zero, and maintain levels of taxation as a proportion of GSP, as well as maintain or increase the Territory’s Net Assets (p. 2.0). The key measures for the long-term objectives are to achieve 90% coverage of accrued superannuation liabilities by 2039-2040 and ensure adequate systems and processes are in place to recognize and mitigate risk (p. 2.0, p. 5.0).\n\nThe Government’s forecast operating result is presented in Table 1.2.2, which describes the General Government Sector for the 2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates (p. 3.0). The table includes data for the years 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, and 2008-09, with the respective actual, estimated, and budget values in millions of dollars (p. 3.0).\n\nSome of the financial objectives and key measures are also listed on page 1.0, which includes:\n1. Maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle;\n2. Maintain low levels of debt;\n3. Provide the highest possible standard of government services;\n4. Service delivery which focuses on people, the environment, and building prosperity;\n5. Maintain a triple A credit rating; and\n6. Effective integration of economic and environmental considerations to promote sustainability of service delivery (p. 1.0).\n\nOverall, the context provides information about the Government's financial policy objectives and strategies, as well as the forecast operating result and key measures for achieving these objectives (p. 2.0, p. 3.0, p. 5.0, p. 1.0)."
