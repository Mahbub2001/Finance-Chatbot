This statement is also consistent with section 11(1)(a) of the Financial Management Act 1996 (p. 1.0). The purpose is further emphasized as being centered around key principles, including achieving and maintaining levels of Territory net worth, managing fiscal risks, pursuing stable and predictable spending and taxing policies, and giving full disclosure of financial information (p. 6.0). \n\nThe key financial objectives outlined in the document aim to achieve a balanced budget over the economic cycle, maintain low levels of debt, and provide adequate provision for long-term liabilities (p. 2.0, p. 6.0). These objectives are guided by principles of responsible financial management, as specified in the Financial Management Act 1996 (p. 5.0), and are designed to support prudent financial management and the principles of inter-generational equity (p. 6.0). \n\nIn summary, the main purpose of the financial policy objectives and strategies statement is to provide transparency and a benchmark for the Government's financial policy, guided by key principles and objectives that support responsible financial management (p. 1.0, p. 2.0, p. 5.0, p. 6.0)."
